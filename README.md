# Udacity_DeepLearning_Nanodegree

Deep Learning projects what I completed.

## component
- NeuralNetwork : I got fundamental comprehension of neural networks and built a bike-sharing prediction code.
- CNN : Convolutional neural networks and a dog-breed classifier using CNN.
- RNN_LSTM : Recurrent Neural Network, Long-Short Term Memory, and a preject which generates TV script.
- GAN : Generative Adversarial Network

## requirement
most of codes are built in Jupyter Notebook with Python3 and `Pytorch` module.
