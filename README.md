# Udacity_DeepLearning_Nanodegree

I am studying deep learning and these are projects what I completed.

## component
- NeuralNetwork : I got fundamental comprehension of neural networks and built a bike-sharing prediction code.
- CNN : I got solid background of convolutional neural networks and made a dog-breed classifier using CNN.

## requirement
most of codes are built in Jupyter Notebook with Python3 and `Pytorch` module.
